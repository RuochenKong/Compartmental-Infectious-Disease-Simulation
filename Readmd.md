# Overview

This repository is the compartmental infectious disease simulation described in the paper
***"EpiScale: Large-Scale Simulation of Infectious Disease Based on Human Mobility \[Demo\]"*** currently under review. 

## Scenarios
In the paper we described 
### Scenario 1
We initialized the disease from **five major airports** (MIA, IAH, PHX, JFK, ORD)
Each with 100 cases initially. These airports are the hypothetical sources of disease input at the early stage of COVID-19

To compare with the real cases:

### Scenario 2
We initialized the disease from the **five largest counties** in Minnesota, namely Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Dakota County, Anoka County, and Washington County. The simulation begins with 100 cases in each selected county.
